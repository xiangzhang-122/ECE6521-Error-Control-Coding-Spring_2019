ISSUE: in 'mogen_log_domain_bcjr.m', there is a bug at line 340 (in the unterminated case): for m=1, the trellis is actullay terminated.
This problem has not yet been fixed here, but is fixed in homework 5. Update this bug after passing the code check for Turbo decoding 
(probably on Mar. 25, Monday ).
