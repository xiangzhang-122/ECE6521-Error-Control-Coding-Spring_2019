This homework focus on the Tanner grapgh-based iterarive decoding of LDPC codes, where the encoding part is not required.
LDPC codes has near-Shannon limit error performance, and is adopted for 5G standard together with polar codes.
------file list----
ldpc_decodoing_test.m is the main file
ldpc_decoder(): the decoder algorithm.
